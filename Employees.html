        <div class = code-text><p>A tax code is a combination of numbers and letters that tells your employer how much income tax to deduct from your pay.</p>
        <p>As you can see, the code on the left is for the tax year ended 5th April 2024.  This individual has their Personal Allowance of £12,570 and income from State Pension of £8,602.  State Pension is not taxed at source and so personal allowances are set against this income, leaving £3,968 allowances remaining.</p>
        <p>The allowances are turned into a tax code by replacing the last number with a letter.  In this case - L.  This individual has a pension with Royal Bank of Scotland and so code 396L is the code that they will use to work out how much tax to deduct from the pension when it is paid each month</p>

                <br>
                <p>Employees pay tax via Pay as You Earn (PAYE). An employer will deduct income tax and national insurance from an employee’s wages before paying them and then pay this over to H M Revenue & Customs (HMRC) together with an employer national insurance contribution.</p>  
                <p>The employer knows how much tax to deduct because HMRC gives them a tax code to use for each of their employees.  A tax code is worked out from the personal allowance and tax reliefs you are entitled to (eg pension relief) less any deductions and employer benefits (eg state pension or company car).</p>
                <p>If you have receive a pension (other than state pension) PAYE is collected in the same way.</p>
